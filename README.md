# Self-Hosted See Non-Printable Characters (Dockerized)

This project is a Dockerized fork of [BurninLeo/see-non-printable-characters](https://github.com/BurninLeo/see-non-printable-characters), which is a simple PHP tool to visualize non-printable characters in text.

The goal of this fork is to make the project easily self-hostable on a local home server using Docker, without requiring any additional setup.

## To self-host SNPC, run: 

`./deploy.sh`

This will create and start a Docker container. Once it's running, you can access the web app at: 

```http://localhost:5151```
